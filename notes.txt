JDK
[ java libraries and java virtual machine]

They are two "public and protected". and then objects like static and return value like void and then main(String args[])

                            public static void main(String[] args) 
                        {  
                             Point p1 = new Point();


classapth = path where jdk stores.

Everything in Java is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods. 
For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight and color, and methods, such as drive and brake. 
A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

validations :

we need to specify the datatype for sure before using it.
number 0 to 9 ,#,! these are not allowed starting variables like a#,1q are invalid.
use CAMEL CASE and uppercases for declaring a variable like 	 int MAX_AGE = 200; and noOfPlayer  = 10;  for easy understanding

variables;
int for numbers,float,char for characters ,long for example 14f in float , f represents floating point.

If we want ot access non primritable types we uses new point().

when we create a class first letter should be captical.

Autoboixng;
keeping an variable(int) in object(Integer) 
  and 
auto-unboxing is vice-versa

A WRAPPER CLASS is a class whose object wraps or contains primitive data types. When we create an object to a wrapper class,
it contains a field and in this field, we can store primitive data types. 
In other words, we can wrap a primitive value into a wrapper class object.

Type of conversion in java 
1.Widening or implict function;

byte - short - int,char - long - float - double
INPUT :

BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
(System.in) is input of two bytes (character contains two bytes) and InputStreamReader reads the character and BufferedReader reads the complete line. [readLine()]

Scanner sr = newline Scanner(System.in);
int x = sr.nextint();
float y = sr.nextfloat;


import java.io.*; //BufferReader
import java.util.*; //scanner
import to java folder into folder io for all(*) classes.

OUTPUT :
System.out.println() prints in line by line order.
System.out.print() prints normal.
System.out.format() for floating point numbers ,date and time .

placeholders begin with percent sign like %d for integers ,%f is for float ,%s for string.
int x = 100;
System.out.format("Value of x %d\n", x);   ['\n'(line feed) arrange in line order]
System.out.format("Value of x %5.2d\n", x); [5 total indicates five charcters eg:    3.14 & .2 indicates after decimal characters.]

Arthematic operaters :
x %= y

&& , || , ! (or) binaray operaters

length() and equals() operators.

Loops :

if(condition)
{  ;} else {  ;}

from exit from a code after contion we use return(end the running of code); like
if(n<0){
println invalid
return;
}

Nested if else loop.

char move = sc.next().charAt(0);
int n = sc.nextInt();

Switch statment

 switch(abc)
	    {
	        case 'L' : x++; break;
	        case 'U' : x-- ; break;
	        default : System.out.println("Invalid");
            }
for loop :
for(Intiliazation;Condtion check; Loop variable change);

while(Condition)
{
}
dont keep semicolum after while(condition) it runs infinite loops like where(condtion){ ;} or where(condtion);

do - while excuetes for one time atleast whether it is true or false , while conditon executes if the conditon is true.
do
{
}while(conditon) 

Break and Condition (Generally these are used with if condition only).

Continue means skip the conditon line doest print whatever  and starts with nxt iteration .
Break as we are rached to the break condtion the loop doesnt run after it.
