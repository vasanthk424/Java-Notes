JDK
[ java libraries and java virtual machine]

They are two public and protected. and then objects like static and return value like void and then main(String args[])

                            public static void main(String[] args) 
                        {  
                             Point p1 = new Point();


classapth = path where jdk stores.

Everything in Java is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods. 
For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight and color, and methods, such as drive and brake. 
A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

validations :

we need to specify the datatype for sure before using it.
number 0 to 9 ,#,! these are not allowed starting variables like a#,1q are invalid.
use CAMEL CASE and uppercases for declaring a variable like 	 int MAX_AGE = 200; and noOfPlayer  = 10;  for easy understanding

variables;
int for numbers,float,char for characters ,long for example 14f in float , f represents floating point.

If we want ot access non primritable types we uses new point().

when we create a class first letter should be captical

Autoboixng;
keeping an variable(int) in object(Integer) 
  and 
auto-unboxing is vice-versa

A WRAPPER CLASS is a class whose object wraps or contains primitive data types. When we create an object to a wrapper class,
it contains a field and in this field, we can store primitive data types. 
In other words, we can wrap a primitive value into a wrapper class object.

Type of conversion in java 
1.Widening or implict function;

byte - short - int,char - long - float - double

2.Narrowing;
